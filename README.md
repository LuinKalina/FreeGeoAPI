FreeGeo API

[![Github made-in](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_In-Berlin-green.svg)](#) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenGeoNet/FreeGeoAPI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenGeoNet/FreeGeoAPI) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/OpenGeoNet/FreeGeoAPI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/OpenGeoNet/FreeGeoAPI?branch=master)

The primary goals of the FreeGeo API are to:

 - Promote learning, and the advancement of geospatial abilities
 - Provide a completely free, and open source platform that lets developers add geo abilities to their applications

 The FreeGeo API is completely free for use, and 100% open source. This project is governed by the MIT license.

 > Note:
 > The FreeGeo API is now part of the OpenGeoNet organization, but is still the same project with the same goals.

This project is generously hosted by [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com) at [https://freegeoapi.org](https://freegeoapi.org). You can find API docs, usage examples and details on contributing to the project there.

Contribute

The best way to start contributing to this (and any OpenGeoNet project) is to read the [OpenGeoNet Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/OpenGeoNet/FreeGeoAPI/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). After you've reviewed the guidelines, fork and code away!

Happy coding! :)

Local Dev

[@nater1067](http://github.com/nater1067) has put together a [quick guide to getting setup](http://nater1067.github.io/blog/2014/08/25/spinning-up-symfony-2-development-environments-with-vagrant/) with [Symfony2](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html) (that's what the FreeGeo API is based on) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com), using [puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/). You can, of course, use whatever configuration you'd like, but I strongly reccommend setting up your local dev like I have for contributions to the FreeGeo API.
